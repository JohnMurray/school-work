# Greedy TSP Solver

The algorithms for solving is nothing extraordinary. However, I would like 
to make a few notes about running the GUI portion of the program.

The code is all in Ruby. You may, or may not, know that Ruby has no built-in
GUI libraries or toolkits. As such, third-party ones must always be used and
that means that you will have to install more than just the Ruby base-install
to get them running.

In this case, I am using Shoes. Shoes is a lightweight framework for GUI
development in Ruby. If you wish to run the program then you must install
Ruby Shoes (http://shoesrb.com). It runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

If you are running on Linux, then there are no distro-installs and it must
be compiled from source (which can sometimes be a pain).

Once you have Shoes installed, you can simply open gui.rb with Shoes to start
the program.
