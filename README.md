school-work
===========

Why not show off some of the work that I have to do for school anyways?
Can't hurt I imagine. And perhaps it will force me to write a little
bit better code for my projects in school.

This is basically a bunch of sym-linked projects from my  local machine
but I figure if I'm going to have to spend a lot of time working on this
stuff that I might as well have something to show people. 

Oh, and this is work is from my currently happening (as of the time
this file was committed) masters program at the Speed School (UofL).
